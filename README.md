TASK DESCRIPTION : This task involved building a Chrome Extension to track and enhance personal productivity. The extension, built with React, allows users to set daily productivity goals, monitor time spent on specific websites, and visualize productivity trends over time. It uses the Chrome Extension API and browser APIs to track browsing activity in real time.

The extension’s core functionality includes the ability for users to set specific daily goals for their time spent on different websites. The app tracks the amount of time a user spends on each site and provides visual feedback (via charts and progress bars) to indicate how close they are to reaching their daily goals. The user interface was built using React to provide a responsive, user-friendly design.

I leveraged browser APIs to monitor the user's browsing activity. Specifically, I used the `chrome.tabs` API to track open tabs, and the `chrome.history` API to gather browsing data over time. This allowed me to build an accurate picture of how the user is spending their time on various websites. The extension tracks the websites visited, time spent on each, and updates the productivity dashboard accordingly.

The app visualizes the data using charts and graphs that display trends in browsing habits, allowing users to see patterns and identify areas where they may need to improve their productivity. I used React for the frontend and integrated charting libraries like Chart.js to present the data in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand way.

In addition to tracking time spent on websites, the extension provides notifications when the user is nearing their daily goals or when they’ve exceeded their set limits. This helps users stay on track and be more mindful of their time.

One of the challenges I faced was integrating the Chrome Extension with React and ensuring smooth communication between the content script, background script, and popup UI. I also worked with Chrome’s manifest file to configure permissions and set up event listeners for tracking website visits.

The extension allows users to review their productivity trends over a customizable time period (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly). This helps users analyze their habits, set new goals, and stay on top of their productivity.

Through this project, I gained experience in building Chrome Extensions, working with browser APIs, and integrating React for a smooth frontend experience. It was a great opportunity to understand how productivity tools can be built and extended to track real-time data within the browser environment.
